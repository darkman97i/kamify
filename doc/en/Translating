## Files to Work With

The files to edit are found under the /_locales folder. When creating a new localised version, a new folder must be created with the appropriate localised folder. Inside, a messages.json file should be created. 

In the /doc files we should create a /doc/<localised>/ folder. The are four files to create:
* Coding. 
* Translating. 
* Using. 
* FAQ. 

The filenames to create SHOULD be translated.
